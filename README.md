Markdown Slide Deck is a lightweight single-page web app that turns an uploaded `.md` file into an interactive presentation. It supports slide splitting with `---`, speaker notes with `--`, rich Markdown/HTML rendering (including tables, media, math, callouts, and Mermaid), keyboard navigation, optional train-line progress map, built-in search across slides, and accessible controls designed for WCAG 2.1-friendly navigation.
