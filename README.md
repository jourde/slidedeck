Markdown Slide Deck is a lightweight single-page web app that turns an uploaded .md file into a presentation. Slides are split with ---, speaker notes are split with -- (and kept hidden in audience view), and navigation works with keyboard arrows/PageUp/PageDown/Space. It supports rich Markdown rendering (via marked), including embedded HTML, centers slide content on screen, and includes an optional bottom “train map” progress line with one clickable station per slide.
